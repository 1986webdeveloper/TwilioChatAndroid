# TwilioChatAndroid
This project depicts twilio chat using functions. In this project, we don't need to create server in any other language (as we needed to do previously). Instead, twilio creates and hosts function that serves as server for us.
To use this code, we need to have account in twilio console. To create function, select the steps shown in the link

Copy the function thus created and replace SERVER_TOKEN_URL in MainActivity.java
